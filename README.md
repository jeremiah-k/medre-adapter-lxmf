# medre-adapter-lxmf

Independent LXMF adapter for MEDRE, extracted from MEDRE commit
`e59c29dd31a95860d1cdbc19e531896616627a68`.

This repository retains the original adapter source history, with original
Git author and committer identity metadata. The import path stays
`medre.adapters.lxmf`; the distribution registers an entry point in
`medre.adapters`, so MEDRE can discover it without a built-in adapter list.

Installation sources (MEDRE and this adapter must share one Python environment):

```bash
# Package index, if/when this distribution is published:
python -m pip install 'medre-adapter-lxmf'

# Git source; replace FULL_COMMIT_SHA with a reviewed 40-character commit ID:
python -m pip install 'medre-adapter-lxmf @ git+https://github.com/jeremiah-k/medre-adapter-lxmf.git@FULL_COMMIT_SHA'

# Local development checkout:
python -m pip install -e ../medre-adapter-lxmf
```

Git installation uses standard Python direct URL requirements, not a custom
MEDRE downloader. To install before MEDRE itself is published, include MEDRE's
Git URL as a dependency source in the same deployment environment. For uv,
use `tool.uv.sources` with an exact Git `rev` or local `path`; commit the
resulting `uv.lock` for reproducibility. Installing an adapter does not require
publishing it on PyPI. Runtime startup never installs or updates dependencies.

After installation/restart, use `medre adapters check --config bridge.yaml` to
verify that the transport is discoverable. See
[MEDRE adapter installation](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/medre/blob/main/docs/ops/adapter-installation.md)
for mixed PyPI/Git/local installations and community adapters.

## Ownership and imports

This distribution owns LXMF's transport implementation, configuration models,
runtime wrapper, fake adapter, native addressing behavior, SDK requirements,
and protocol/SDK tests. MEDRE core owns generic events, routing, lifecycle,
storage, evidence, configuration orchestration, and installed-package discovery.

| Surface         | Adapter-owned import                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Config models   | `medre.config.adapters.lxmf`                           |
| Runtime wrapper | `medre.config.adapters.lxmf_runtime.LxmfRuntimeConfig` |
| SDK-free fake   | `medre.adapters.fakes.lxmf.FakeLxmfAdapter`            |

Import the runtime wrapper from this distribution directly. Core has no named
wrapper compatibility bridge or transport SDK extras. The supported MEDRE
interface range and native SDK pins are declared in this project's
`pyproject.toml`; use a matching core revision during pre-release development.
Community adapter authors can use their own distribution names, import packages,
and hosting sources with the same `medre.adapters` entry-point contract.

License: GPL-3.0-or-later for the original MEDRE-authored adapter files.
Upstream SDK licenses remain separate and must be reviewed for redistribution.
The LXMF/RNS integration in particular does **not** gain license insulation
merely by being moved to another repository.

## Offline samples and diagnostics

This distribution contributes native fake values and an opaque conversation
address to `medre config sample`. Core includes only installed contributors;
a single contributor gets two fake instances for offline routing. Native
packet simulation methods remain adapter-specific. Run-session canonical
callback injection uses `AdapterContract.publish_inbound(event)`.

`medre adapters check --config bridge.yaml` distinguishes missing distributions
from broken/conflicting entry points. Basic CLI help and unrelated healthy
providers remain available when another provider fails discovery.

Replies and threads relay as inline fallback text. They do not emit native
reply/thread operations. Delivery evidence identifies `fallback_text`;
reactions, edits, and deletes remain unsupported and are suppressed.
Fake adapters expose the same planning capabilities as their health reports.

## Tests

Protocol and SDK contract tests live in this repository with adapter-owned
helpers. Cross-adapter routing and lifecycle tests remain in MEDRE. Run the
following from this repository in a fresh virtual environment, with a matching
MEDRE checkout at `../medre`.

```bash
# SDK-free fake tier: core dev supplies test tooling; skip this adapter's SDK deps.
python -m pip install -e '../medre[dev]'
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
python -m pytest -q

# Native SDK tier: this distribution supplies its own SDK pins.
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
python -m pytest -v -m "lxmf_sdk and not local_integration and not soak and not live and not hardware and not docker"
```

The default pytest selection excludes SDK, service, hardware, local integration,
and soak tiers. Installing SDKs afterward leaves the same environment SDK-enabled;
use a fresh environment for a new SDK-free proof.

Deterministic local endpoint integration is also owned here. After installing
the SDK tier, select it explicitly:

```bash
python -m pytest -v -m "local_integration and not soak and not live and not hardware and not docker"
```

Soak remains opt-in and is separate from deterministic local integration.

## Fake smoke sources

The fake provides a synchronous `make_event(text=..., event_kind=...)` returning
a canonical event with its own adapter instance ID. After installing all
providers referenced by a fake bridge config, exercise a source with:

```bash
medre smoke --config bridge.yaml --source-adapter ADAPTER_ID --json
```

Use the configured instance ID, which may differ from the transport name. Each
normal smoke tests one source; inspect `source_candidates` and
`coverage_scope: single_source` in its report. Eligible sources must have started
and provide the helper. A pass requires delivery for every matched configured
route target, including targets unavailable after construction or startup.
Factory errors fail the smoke and trigger runtime cleanup. The result proves
fake direct-pipeline behavior; native callbacks and recipient delivery have
separate qualification tiers.

## Coordinated CI

The repository CI installs MEDRE core and this adapter. Its fake job omits
native SDK dependencies; its SDK job installs this distribution's declared pins.
CI tests against MEDRE `main` by default. Set the repository Actions variable
`MEDRE_CORE_REF` to a branch or commit during coordinated core development;
the manual workflow input `core_ref` overrides it. Clear the variable after
the compatible core revision reaches `main`.

Core's compatibility matrix tests each selected adapter at the exact commit
recorded in its manifest, along with cross-adapter behavior. In a coordinated
checkout containing the selected sibling repos, run from MEDRE:

```bash
python scripts/ci/adapter_matrix.py --check-local
# Once all adapter changes are committed:
python scripts/ci/adapter_matrix.py --sync-local
```

The helper validates clean sibling checkouts and their entry points, and compares
Python distribution names using normalized case/separator spelling. Synchronizing
updates the manifest atomically without fetching or installing packages. Review
the manifest diff, publish adapter commits first, then publish the core pin
update. A failed write preserves the original manifest and cleans up the temporary
file. Deployment projects should separately lock their chosen complete
package graph.

Standalone CI records the exact core and adapter SHAs tested against its
configured core baseline. MEDRE core CI qualifies the pinned compatibility
pair; a standalone green result does not qualify another core revision.
SDK qualification extras come from the selected core compatibility manifest,
while SDK versions remain authoritative in this adapter's package metadata.

## Provider contract and quality

The [registration reference](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/medre/blob/main/docs/dev/adapter-registration.md)
documents every hook, its loading phase, and the minimal fake constructor/event
calls. Shared native-metadata helpers are public under `medre.adapters.metadata`.
Conformance tests use `medre.testing`; SDK pin checks read this distribution's
installed metadata while this repository chooses its SDK qualification extras.
The fake constructor and explicit-keyword event factory are checked in the
SDK-free tier. Native schemas and validated examples live in `docs/schemas` here.

This repository declares its own Ruff/Black policy. CI checks all Python source
and tests, plus commit whitespace, alongside the fake/native qualification tiers.
The native adapter package includes its own `py.typed` marker.
