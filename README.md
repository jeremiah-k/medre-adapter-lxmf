# medre-adapter-lxmf

Independent lxmf adapter for MEDRE, extracted from MEDRE commit
`e59c29dd31a95860d1cdbc19e531896616627a68`.

This repository retains the original adapter source history, with original
Git author and committer identity metadata. The import path stays
`medre.adapters.lxmf`; the distribution registers an entry point in
`medre.adapters`, so MEDRE can discover it without a built-in adapter list.

Installation sources (MEDRE and this adapter must share one Python environment):

```bash
# Package index, if/when this distribution is published:
python -m pip install 'medre-adapter-lxmf'

# Git source; replace FULL_COMMIT_SHA with a reviewed 40-character commit ID:
python -m pip install 'medre-adapter-lxmf @ git+https://github.com/jeremiah-k/medre-adapter-lxmf.git@FULL_COMMIT_SHA'

# Local development checkout:
python -m pip install -e ../medre-adapter-lxmf
```

Git installation uses standard Python direct URL requirements, not a custom
MEDRE downloader. To install before MEDRE itself is published, include MEDRE's
Git URL as a dependency source in the same deployment environment. For uv,
use `tool.uv.sources` with an exact Git `rev` or local `path`; commit the
resulting `uv.lock` for reproducibility. Installing an adapter does not require
publishing it on PyPI. Runtime startup never installs or updates dependencies.

After installation/restart, use `medre adapters check --config bridge.yaml` to
verify that the transport is discoverable. See
[MEDRE adapter installation](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/medre/blob/main/docs/ops/adapter-installation.md)
for mixed PyPI/Git/local installations and community adapters.

Upstream SDK licenses remain separate and must be reviewed for redistribution.
The LXMF/RNS integration in particular does **not** gain license insulation
merely by being moved to another repository.

## Tests

Protocol, SDK contract, and local integration tests live in this repository.
They use adapter-owned helpers; the MEDRE checkout's `tests` package is not
required. Cross-adapter routing and lifecycle tests remain in MEDRE.

```bash
python -m pip install -e ../medre -e '.[test]'
python -m pytest -q
python -m pytest -m "lxmf_sdk and not local_integration and not soak" -v
```

The default tier uses deterministic fakes. Hardware, live services, SDK
contracts, local integration, and soak tests are opt-in through pytest markers.

The repository CI installs only MEDRE core and this adapter. Its fake job
omits all native SDKs; the SDK job uses this distribution's declared pins.
`workflow_dispatch` accepts a MEDRE `core_ref` for coordinated changes. Core's
separate compatibility matrix tests the assembled first-party adapter set.

## Coordinated CI

CI tests against MEDRE `main` by default. Set the repository Actions variable
`MEDRE_CORE_REF` to a branch or commit during coordinated core development;
the manual workflow input `core_ref` overrides it. Clear the variable after
the compatible core revision reaches `main`. Core CI also tests this adapter
against the exact provider revision recorded in its compatibility manifest.
